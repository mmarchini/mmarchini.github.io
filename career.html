                  <ul>
                    <li>Participated on the on call rotation for the Node.js Platform running at the edge, which handles the majority of API traffic coming from netflix.com and other devices</li>
                    <li>Identified and fixed several performance issues on the aforementioned platform, including but not limited to memory leaks (on application code, platform code and Node.js/V8), high CPU, event loop locking, latency, and more</li>
                    <li>Used a varied array of tools to conduct performance analysis, including but not limited to metrics, distributed tracing, logs, V8 CPU and Heap profilers, BPF tools such as memleak and bpftrace, and more</li>
                    <li>Proposed and helped implement improvements to our on call rotation</li>
                    <li>Represented Netflix as a TC39 delegate on several meetings</li>
                    <li>Currently I lead migrations and upgrades that require performance analysis before moving forward. When performance issues are identified, I discover the best way to mitigate those issues so migrations can move forward. Some examples include:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Migrated our logging system to utilize Sentry. The default Sentry integration incurred a performance impact of 12% to 50% increase in CPU, therefore I had to overhaul our entire logging system to allow integrating Sentry without the overhead, while also being careful to not make any breaking changes</li>
                        <li>Migrated our distributed tracing stack to OpenTelemetry, improving performance of certain application up to 25%</li>

              <div>
                <p>Aug 2017 - Dec 2018</p>
                <p>During my last year at Fleye, I was the engineer assigned to
                our Netflix contract, where I contributed to Open Source
                projects by fixing issues and implementing features as
                requested, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed longstanding issues between Node.js and Linux perf by making changes to V8 code generation pipeline. The changes ensured that Linux perf was able to profile Node.js code paths running on V8’s interpreter (Ignition) as well as JIT compiled code paths (TurboFan). Previously, only JIT compiled code paths were profilable</li>
                  <li>Created libstapsdt, the first and only dynamic solution to register USDT probes on Linux. The library generates ELF shared libraries on the fly, those libraries contain the user-space trace probes. It then links those libraries to the running application to make the probes available to tracers</li>
                  <li>Worked to improve llnode and keep it up to date with Node.js releases. This work requires understanding of V8 internals</li>
                  <li>Was part of the team maintaining bpftrace early on, where I contributed with new language features, optimizations, bug fixes, etc. Our goal was to make bpftrace a robust, complete, production-ready tracer. We achieved that goal and I presented bpftrace at Linux Plumbers Conference 2018</li>
                  <li>Participated in the Node.js Diagnostics Working Group, with a focus on production diagnostic tools</li>
                  <li>Gave talks at conferences about tools related to or created by me while on this role</li>
                  <li>Participated at in-person summits where decisions were made about open source projects, including Node.js Diagnostics Summits, Node.js/OpenJS Collaborators Summit, and Linux Plumbers Conference (BPF track)During my last year at Fleye, I was the engineer assigned to our Netflix contract, where I contributed to Open Source projects by fixing issues and implementing features as requested, including: • Fixed longstanding issues between Node.js and Linux perf by making changes to V8 code generation pipeline.
